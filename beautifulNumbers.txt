/*
Given a range of numbered days,[i ... j]  and a number k, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where [i-reverse(i)] is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.

Function Description:
beautifulDays has the following parameter(s):

i: the starting day number
j: the ending day number
k: the divisor

Example: 
Input: 20 23 6
Ouput: 2"  
 
Lily may go to the movies on days 20,21,22 and 23. We perform the following calculations to determine which days are beautiful:

Day 20 is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number: 20-02/6 = 18/6 = 3
Day 21 is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: 21-12/6 = 9/6 = 1.5
Day 22 is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number: 22-22/6 = 0/6 = 0
Day 23 is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: 23-32/6 = 9/6 = 1.5
Only two day , 20  and 22, in this interval are beautiful. Thus, we print 2 as our answer.
