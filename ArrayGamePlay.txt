// Andy wants to play a game with his little brother, Bob. The game starts with an array of distinct integers and the rules are as follows:

// Bob always plays first and the two players move in alternating turns.
// In a single move, a player chooses the maximum element currently present in the array and removes it as well as all the other elements to its right. For example, if the starting array arr =[2,3,5,4,1], then it becomes arr=[2,3] after the first move because we remove the maximum element (i.e., 5) and all elements to its right (i.e., 4 and 1).
// The modifications made to the array during each turn are permanent, so the next player continues the game with the remaining array. The first player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
// Andy and Bob play 'g' games. Given the initial array for each game, find and print the name of the winner on a new line. If Andy wins, print ANDY; if Bob wins, print BOB.

// To continue the example above, in the next move Andy will remove 3. Bob will then remove 2 and win because

// there are no more integers to remove.

// Function Description

// Complete the gamingArray function. It should return a string that represents the winner, either ANDY or BOB.

// gamingArray has the following parameter(s):
// arr: an array of integers 

// Test cases:
// Test case1: 5 2 6 3 4
// Test case2: 3 1

// Test Result:
// ANDY
// BOB

// For Example:
// Initial array:
// [5 2 6 3 4]
// In the first move, Bob removes 6 and all the elements to its right, resulting in Arr= [5,2]
// In the second move, Andy removes 5 and all the elements to its right, resulting in Arr = []:
// At this point, the array is empty and Bob cannot make any more moves. This means Andy wins, so we print ANDY on a new line.
